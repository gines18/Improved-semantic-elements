In this project, I have made an effort to make use of semantic elements to ensure better accessibility, search engine optimization, maintainability, and improved browser rendering. By using semantic elements such as header, main, article, section, aside, and <footer>, I have provided additional information and structure to the content, making it easier for assistive technologies, search engines, and browsers to understand and interpret the pages. This has helped to improve the user experience and overall quality of the project.
